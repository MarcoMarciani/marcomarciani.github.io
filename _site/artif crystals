Artificial non-commutative crystals

Artificial crystals let us go beyond the contraints imposed by Chemistry. They are systems with regular patterns but with atoms replaced by other artificial, fundamental units, for instance circuit resonators or mechanical springs. What typically moves inside these devices are bosonic particle modes (light, vibrations etc...), and their behavior can display interesting Physics. For instance, there have been experimental implementations of hyperbolic curved geometries which would be impossible for natural crystals in our Euclidean space. Unfortunately, such implementations were quite awkward. I contributed the topic showing that artificial crystals can be used to mimic the motion of electrons under magnetic fields even though no magnetic field is applied from outside. What is more, several electrons can be dropped in the lattice in such a way that they all bear a different magnetic field configuration. And all of this generalizes to arbitrary gauge-fields while keeping the crystal architecture very scalable and apt for experimental realizations. This is very exciting and goes in the direction of implementing a full lattice gauge theory. Will it happen?
