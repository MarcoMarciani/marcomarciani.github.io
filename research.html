					<h2>RMT of mesoscopic systems</h2>

				<p>I devoted most part of the Ph.D. to the study of the <b>random-matrix theory</b> (RMT) for quantum dots
					hosting unpaired Majorana states. <b>Quantum dots</b> are artificial atoms -- that is, with discrete energies -- that emerge at interfaces
					between different electronic materials at micron and submicron level.
					Majorana states are predicted to appear at the boundaries of topological superconductors
					and they are of great interest for <b>quantum computation</b>. A couple of two spatially-separated unpaired Majorana states
					can be used to encode a non-local qubit<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> that is expected to be robust
					against moderate imperfections of fabrication. Considering that the solid state community is putting a lot of efforts
					in detecting such states, it is natural to ask which thermodynamic signatures of Majorana states
					are likely to stay visible in a randomly disordered interface. Will the disorder wash out any signature of their presence? 
					<b>Density of state, thermal conductance and thermopower</b> are just
					some of the quantities I studied in this context. Depending on the symmetries of the system,
					in certain cases their probability distributions have been found to be strongly affected by the presence 
					(or absence) of Majorana unpaired states. A question has never been answered: can Majorana unpaired states be experimentally detected
					in a probabilist way, by varying the disorder, building up hystograms of the measured thermodynamic quantities and comparing with
					the prediction of RMT?</span></p>

					<h2>Dissipative quantum systems</h2>

				<p> 
					To a great extent it is possible to study a classical systems in isolation, that is, without considering the effect of the environment. 
					Often friction and radiative losses can be neglected from the energy budget of the system.
					This is not the case for quantum systems, where the <b>interaction</b> with the environment is typically strong<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" hidden> since the system energies
					are as small as those related to the friction and losses.
					<b>Josephson junctions</b> (JJ) are superconducting devices -- made with aluminium or niobium or tantalum, etc. -- 
					where some energy states are well separated from
					the other energies. Separation means that a good control may be achieved, in particular, to encode qubits. In transmonic devices
					qubit coherence times can execeed hundreds of microseconds but longer times are needed to achieve robust quantum computing and storage.

					I studied the effect that a metallic substrate of a JJ has on the <b>dissipation</b> of the current flowing across the device. Dissipation can be
					described by Hamiltonian terms that induce non-Hermiticity, and in turns, complex energy levels. <b>Non-Hermitian physics</b> is been a hot
					topic in optics and is nowadays gaining attention in condensed matter. Can the reachness and simplicity of non-Hermitian physics be exploited to engineer
					JJ with peculiar and non-intuitive properties? Can coherence times be engineered using the dissipation itself? This are only some of the questions
					that I am trying to answer.</span></p>
